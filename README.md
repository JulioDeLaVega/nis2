## Interface for the Article 9 of the GDPR

This app is a tool to self-assess the compliance level regarding the **processing of health data** with the General Data Protection Regulation.

It was designed in **React** and the functions written in **Javascript**. Javascript was not included as a possible language but it does not really make sense for me to write the code in Python since I directly built a React app.
